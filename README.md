A Poker game developed in Python with use of the flet as user interface
With 2 players, one npc who always call and no big-blind and a IMPOSSIBLE MODE, A "difficulty setting" which would make impossible 
for a player to win, that may or may not have in any big online poker game(James Doakes from Dexter memes intensifies)

I did not use any poker game logic already developed, and tried to develop my own logic, rank for the hands, everything.
Still a work in progress as I want to implement Big blinds, more players..
